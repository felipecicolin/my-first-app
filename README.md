# README

This was my first ever Ruby on Rails app, made with the intention to start learning Ruby. The application consists in a simple CRUD app. It does not have any field validations or anything like that. It's just a CRUD. The application also has a searchbar to search for users in the userlist.

Access the application on: https://my-first-app-ruby.herokuapp.com/
